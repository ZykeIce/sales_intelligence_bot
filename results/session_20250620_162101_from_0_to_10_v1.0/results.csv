REASONING:
To arrive at the 25% probability that Sonder would be interested in the Autonomous Brainy product, I considered several key factors:

1. **Industry Fit**: Sonder operates in the hospitality and real estate sector, focusing on providing unique stays through a digital platform. While AI technology could enhance their operations (e.g., through data analysis, customer service automation, etc.), their primary business model does not heavily rely on high-performance computing or AI model training.

  - Hiring Activity: +5%
  - Budget Constraints: -5%

**Final Calculation**:  
50% + 15% + 10% + 15% + 10% + 5% - 5% = 75%

### Conclusion:
I did not choose a higher percentage because while the alignment and growth signals are strong, the potential budget constraints and the competitive nature of the market could limit immediate interest. A lower percentage was not chosen due to the significant positive indicators that suggest a strong likelihood of interest.
