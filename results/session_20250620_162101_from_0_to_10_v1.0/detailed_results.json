But that doesn't mean the sunshine has to feel quite so far away. Bring the outdoors indoors with turf inspired seating or grass installations. This is particularly a great option for stadium seating and open floor space. officesnapshots.com Add some color and freshness with turf inspired setting in break out areas. Great for personal work and meet ups. officedesigngallery.com Use a fabric that mimics grass as an upholstery option for furniture. The benches above are also made with unfinished wood and placed on wheels for a natural feel and multi-functional design. diyandmag.com The seating installation above has grass weaving between seats so that workers can face outward or inward (and maybe even feel the grass between their toes). abduzeedo.com A grass inspired rug is a great way to brighten up a room. architectureinteriordesigns.com Grass inspired stadium seating is also great for lecture and presentation rooms. examiner.com Create rolling hills and playful shapes with turf inspired seating. Comment Turn your wall to art with sculptural wall paneling February 1, 2016 Sculptural wall paneling brings a space to life by adding three-dimensional architectural components. Texture immediately draws the eye and creates an artistic focal point. modularArts modularArts created InterlockingRock panels that can easily be layered together and cut to accommodate any wall shape. via Pinterest Wall paneling with metals and woods is a great way to create a modern look. Above, the slight variation of color and exposed bolts emphasizes an urban raw feel. via Pinterest The design above plays with gradient so that part of the wall raises. Those areas that are lifted also use color to highlight this variance. If this is done to a ceiling, it could be interesting to add lighting along the exposed cracks. via Pinterest The use of an inlayed pattern above draws the eye and carries the viewer across the space. Turning the wall into the main statement of the room makes it easy to use minimal and simple furniture design. This is also a good option for transitional spaces, like this hallway, where furniture is not needed. via Pinterest Wall texture is more than artistic form, it can function to aid acoustics. Above, the use of pattern helps to absorb sound making it a great option for offices or restaurants. I particularly like the way the repeating pattern starts to fade out and darker neutrals transition to white and pops of sky blue. Comment To have a desk or not have a desk? Advantages and disadvantages to personalized work space at the office January 21, 2016 It has been the main working assumption that employees need a personal desk to make their own. However this may not be necessary for every office environment. Are there advantages to working in shared communal spaces and what would that look like? How would this choice impact company culture? Here in Silicon Valley open work space has become the standard trend. Without cubicles there's a sense of connectedness and community. Since everyone is out there together, everyone is equally valued. This energy can inspire purpose, motivation, and accountability. How a company arranges open seating may be based around team, project, or client. This depends on the business and where the most direct communication is needed. To increase ease of contact between collaborators means less emails and faster internal updates. There is a level of flexibility in this model because teams, projects, and clients shift. Furthermore, employees often work with multiple teams, projects, and clients. Therefore deciding the best method for seating has to take into account this fluidity. Regardless of organizing around collaboration, there are also times when employees need to retreat to private work areas. Open office design should always have a variety of zones such as conference rooms, casual seating, or partially walled spaces. F2 Design Seating choice empowers employees to take care of their personal well-being by deciding which space will support their most creative and productive self. Perkins+Will performed an in-house experiment where part of an office opted to let go of their personal seating and choose a new place to sit every day. The goal was to explore better use of space and how this could benefit the employee, company, environmental footprint, and research about mobility in the workplace. Some things they discovered: 1. This could make it difficult to find each other. 2. They needed more personal storage. 3. There was low cleaning accountability. And 4. Technological needs vary, and with this seating model either every desk is equipped the same, or there are technology created zones of work. In this way without any seating coordination, it may be difficult for teams to collaborate and employees may waste time carrying items, cleaning, and gaining access to proper technology. F2Design Seating arrangements based on team, project, or client, allow a company to better internal communication and thus productivity. While this is a flexible model, employees have a desk for a period of time where they can keep their work organized and place grounding personal mementos. However inevitably employees will be working with other teams, projects, and clients and so have to find other communal spaces to gather. With the popularity of open work space, desks are no longer personal silos, and yet how a company chooses to organize people together is still up for exploration. Just how personal or communal a space needs to be depends on the business and employee needs. Comment Flexible Office Design: Spaces that serve employee solitude and collaboration January 8, 2016 In today's workplace employees move between individual work flow and collaboration. Flexible space design offers employees choice. There are a few ways to create multi-functional areas so that design simultaneously supports a private work session or a small group meeting. Remind Office by F2Design Above F2Design incorporated a repurposed shipping container to create multiple zones for the office. In one moment this is a quiet space for focus. In another moment, a small group gathers here to check in. Then later, someone lays down on the net ceiling to take a break. The point is, the space is flexible enough to accommodate various needs. Primafila Sofa Modular seating allows you to play with different formations for seating areas. The use of modular furniture, which can quickly be arranged to accommodate small or larger work sessions is an easy way to keep the space flexible. Bikini Island by Werner Aisslinger for Moroso Designing an island area allows people to choose how to sit and which direction to face, creating the possibility for solitude or collaboration. Adding small tables and cushions offers more options for work and gathering. Bikini Island by Werner Aisslinger for Moroso Below, these tree house inspired pieces on wheels and can come together to connect into a larger unit or remain separate for private work space. They were designed specifically for a co-working office where there are constantly new groups of people coming and going and flexible design is critical. Designed by Dymitr Malcew 1 Comment The Power of Paint: Unique Wall Murals for Your Space December 9, 2015 At F2 we like to make a statement by playing with bold wall color and incorporating painted patterns. Color and pattern direct the eye and lead the observer through space. Varying the design of a single wall or entire room creates different zones of use. When you mirror color and pattern in two areas, they can also become linked. Often in larger open spaces we will repeat aspects of a mural design in order to connect the space into a cohesive story. In the image below, we used geometric patterns in repetition to create a clean look that is similar to wallpaper, but feels like an indoor street mural. Painting the pattern allows you to choose how much of the wall to cover and how subtle or dramatic your look. We like to work with local artists to design one of a kind murals specific to the project and relevant to our client. Here are a few reasons why you might want to consider a wall mural for your home or office: Represent local artists, create your own art, and rock an original art piece on your wall Have a small space? No worries- paint, color, and pattern are an easy way to create a dynamic design without having to physically take up space Change it up! It's easy to paint and repaint- allow your space to be fluid and exploratory In the image above we played with painting the negative space instead of the pattern itself. Simply tape off wall sections and fill in with color as you feel inspired. In the image below we balanced bright pink with neutrals through the use of pattern. Comment Reduce Employee Stress Through Design: Incorporating Repurposed Wood and Air Plants November 29, 2015 The workplace can easily become stressful, but it’s difficult to be an imaginative and productive employee when we are clouded by stress. The design of a space can help to facilitate ease and comfort in a work environment. F2 Design has made sure there are always natural elements added to our projects for just this reason. Aesthetically juxtaposing modern furniture with the use of greenery and raw wood creates an open, clean, and fresh feeling. Below, F2 created a repurposed wood wall and added moss and air plants as a way to make the space feel more alive. Air plants are a popular design element because they do not require soil in order to live. You can make your own terrariums or hang them with an art piece. We also created an air plant wall with simple prongs so that the plants appear to be floating. Above we used repurposed wood and added floating air plants. Below, the textured wood in contrast to the green paint adds a dynamic design to a smaller conference room. F2 enjoys the use of bold color because it brightens the space. Incorporating natural elements into space design can bring the calm we feel outdoors indoors. A relaxed work environment allows employees to be open to inspiration and thus create more innovative and productive work. 1 Comment For more information about F2Design contact info@f2design.com and link to our social media below!",

This uncertainty decreases the probability.\n\n4. **Urgency and Need**: There is no indication from the company's website or content that they are currently engaged in AI development or require significant computational resources for model training or inference. This lack of urgency or need for the product further decreases the probability.\n\n5. **Potential for Future Interest**: While the company may not currently have a need for AI workstations, there is a possibility that as technology evolves, they may explore AI solutions for enhancing their design processes. However, this is speculative and does not significantly impact the current probability.\n\nBased on these factors, I estimate the probability of interest in the Autonomous Brainy product to be around 30%. This number reflects the understanding that while there is a slight chance they could be interested in high-performance computing in the future, their current focus and industry positioning do not align well with the product offering.\n\n- **OPEN ROLES**: None found.\n- **RECENT NEWS OR GROWTH SIGNALS**: None found.\n- **PRODUCT FIT**: Weak fit. The company focuses on design and workspace aesthetics rather than AI development or computational needs.\n- **RED FLAGS**: None found.",

    "ai_reasoning": "PERCENTAGE: [25%]\n\nREASONING:\nTo arrive at the 25% probability that Sonder would be interested in the Autonomous Brainy product, I considered several key factors:\n\n1. **Industry Fit**: Sonder operates in the hospitality and real estate sector, focusing on providing unique stays through a digital platform. While AI technology could enhance their operations (e.g., through data analysis, customer service automation, etc.), their primary business model does not heavily rely on high-performance computing or AI model training. This factor decreases the probability of interest.\n\n2. **Company Size and Structure**: Sonder is a relatively large company with approximately 1,400 employees. Larger companies often have more resources to invest in technology, but they also tend to have established systems and processes that may not require the cutting-edge capabilities offered by the Autonomous Brainy. This factor is neutral, as it neither significantly increases nor decreases the probability.\n\n3. **Budget**: The price range of the Autonomous Brainy series (from $5,000 to $32,000) suggests that it is a significant investment. While Sonder may have the budget for such purchases, the necessity of such high-performance AI workstations is questionable given their current operational needs. This factor decreases the probability.\n\n4. **Urgency and Need**: There is no indication from the provided text that Sonder is currently seeking to enhance their AI capabilities or that they have an immediate need for high-performance computing. This lack of urgency further decreases the probability.\n\n5. **Recent Growth Signals**: There are no recent news articles or announcements indicating that Sonder is expanding into areas that would require advanced AI capabilities. This absence of growth signals also contributes to a lower probability of interest.\n\nBased on these considerations, I estimated the probability of interest at 25%. I did not choose a higher number because the core business of Sonder does not align closely with the capabilities of the Autonomous Brainy product, and there are no strong indicators of a need for such technology. Conversely, I did not choose a lower number than 25% because there is a possibility that they could explore AI solutions in the future, albeit not urgently.\n\n**OPEN ROLES**: None found.\n\n**RECENT NEWS OR GROWTH SIGNALS**: No recent news or signals of growth/expansion were found in the provided text.\n\n**PRODUCT FIT**: The fit between Sonder and the Autonomous Brainy product is weak.

    "ai_reasoning": "PERCENTAGE: [30%]  \nREASONING:  \n\nTo arrive at the probability that MuteSix would be interested in the Autonomous Brainy product, I considered several key factors, both positive and negative, that could influence their interest level.\n\n### Key Factors Considered:\n\n1. **Industry Alignment**:  \n   - **Positive**: MuteSix operates in the digital marketing and performance marketing space, which increasingly relies on advanced data analytics and AI technologies to optimize campaigns and improve targeting. The Autonomous Brainy, with its high-performance AI capabilities, could potentially enhance their analytical capabilities.\n   - **Negative**: However, MuteSix primarily focuses on marketing services rather than AI development or research. Their core business does not directly involve developing AI models or infrastructure, which may limit their interest in a high-performance AI workstation.\n\n2. **Company Size and Budget**:  \n   - **Positive**: MuteSix is a leading D2C agency with significant revenue generation (over $1.2 billion in direct revenue). This suggests they have the financial resources to invest in high-end technology if they see a clear benefit.\n   - **Negative**: The specific need for such high-performance workstations is uncertain. Their current operations may not require the level of computational power that the Autonomous Brainy offers, especially if they are not directly engaged in AI model training or development.\n\n3. **Urgency and Product Fit**:  \n   - **Negative**: There is no immediate indication that MuteSix is looking to upgrade their technology or invest in new AI infrastructure. Their focus appears to be on marketing strategies rather than on developing or deploying AI models, which diminishes the urgency for such a product.\n   - **Product Fit**: The fit is unclear. While the workstation could theoretically enhance their capabilities, it does not align directly with their stated services or immediate needs.\n\n4. **Hiring Activity**:  \n   - **Open Roles**: None found.

I rounded this to 30% to account for their strong revenue position, which could allow for discretionary spending on technology if a compelling case is made.\n\n### Conclusion:\nI did not choose a higher number because the company’s focus on marketing rather than AI development suggests limited interest in high-performance AI workstations. Conversely, I did not choose a lower number because their financial capacity and the potential for future interest in AI technologies could still warrant some level of consideration.\n\n---\n\n### OPEN ROLES: \nNone found.\n\n### RECENT NEWS OR GROWTH SIGNALS: \nNo recent news or signals of growth were identified in the provided text.\n\n### PRODUCT FIT: \nUnclear fit.

    "ai_reasoning": "PERCENTAGE: [15%]\n\nREASONING:\nTo arrive at the probability that Starkey Laboratories would be interested in the Autonomous Brainy AI workstation series, I considered several key factors:\n\n1. **Industry Alignment**: Starkey operates in the hearing aid and audiology industry, focusing on enhancing hearing through advanced technology. The Autonomous Brainy is designed for AI development, research, and deployment, which does not directly align with Starkey's core business of hearing aids. This significantly decreases the probability of interest. (Negative impact)\n\n2. **Product Fit**: The Autonomous Brainy is tailored for AI developers and researchers, particularly in fields requiring high computational power for model training and inference. Starkey's focus is on hearing technology, which may utilize AI but does not require the same level of computational resources as AI model training. This weakens the product fit further. (Negative impact)\n\n3. **Company Size and Focus**: Starkey is a well-established company with a specific focus on hearing aids and related technologies. Their investment in AI appears to be more about enhancing their existing products rather than developing new AI models or systems. This suggests that their budget and strategic direction may not prioritize high-performance AI workstations. (Negative impact)\n\n4. **Budget Considerations**: The price range of the Autonomous Brainy workstations (from $5,000 to $32,000) may be outside of Starkey's immediate budget for new technology, especially if they are not directly related to their core product offerings. This further decreases the likelihood of interest. (Negative impact)\n\n5. **Urgency and Need**: There is no indication from the provided text that Starkey is currently seeking to expand their AI capabilities or invest in high-performance computing resources. Without a clear need or urgency, the probability of interest remains low. (Negative impact)\n\nBased on these factors, I estimate a low probability of 15%. The negative impacts from industry alignment, product fit, company focus, budget considerations, and urgency collectively lead to this conclusion. A higher percentage was not chosen due to the clear misalignment between Starkey's business model and the intended use of the Autonomous Brainy workstations.\n\n**OPEN ROLES**: None found.\n\n**RECENT NEWS OR GROWTH SIGNALS**: The text provided does not contain any recent news or growth signals related to Starkey Laboratories.\n\n**PRODUCT FIT**: Weak fit.
