REASONING:  

To arrive at the probability that the company would be interested in the Autonomous Brainy AI workstation series, I considered several key factors:

1. **Industry Fit**: The company specializes in dental practice management software. While AI can be beneficial in healthcare, particularly in diagnostics and patient management, the specific application of high-performance AI workstations is less directly relevant to dental software development. This factor decreases the probability of interest.

2. **Company Size and Focus**: The text indicates that the company offers comprehensive software solutions for dental practices. This suggests a focus on software rather than hardware, which may limit their interest in investing in high-performance AI workstations. This factor also decreases the probability.

3. **Budget Considerations**: The price range of the Autonomous Brainy workstations is between $5,000 and $32,000. Given that the company is focused on providing affordable solutions for dental practices, it may not have the budget or inclination to invest heavily in high-performance hardware, especially if their current infrastructure meets their needs. This factor further decreases the probability.

4. **Urgency and Need**: There is no indication from the provided text that the company is currently seeking to enhance its AI capabilities or expand into areas that would require such high-performance workstations. Without a clear need or urgency, the probability of interest decreases.

5. **Recent News or Growth Signals**: The text does not provide any recent news or signals of growth that would indicate the company is expanding its capabilities or looking to invest in new technology. This lack of growth signals further decreases the probability.

Based on these considerations, I estimate the probability of interest at 15%. The reasoning behind not choosing a higher number is primarily due to the lack of direct relevance of the product to the company's core business and the absence of any signals indicating a need for such technology. A lower number was not chosen because there is still a possibility that the company may explore AI solutions in the future, albeit at a low probability.

**Calculation Process**:
