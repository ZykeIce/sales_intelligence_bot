But that doesn't mean the sunshine has to feel quite so far away. Bring the outdoors indoors with turf inspired seating or grass installations. This is particularly a great option for stadium seating and open floor space. officesnapshots.com Add some color and freshness with turf inspired setting in break out areas. Great for personal work and meet ups. officedesigngallery.com Use a fabric that mimics grass as an upholstery option for furniture. The benches above are also made with unfinished wood and placed on wheels for a natural feel and multi-functional design. diyandmag.com The seating installation above has grass weaving between seats so that workers can face outward or inward (and maybe even feel the grass between their toes). abduzeedo.com A grass inspired rug is a great way to brighten up a room. architectureinteriordesigns.com Grass inspired stadium seating is also great for lecture and presentation rooms. examiner.com Create rolling hills and playful shapes with turf inspired seating. Comment Turn your wall to art with sculptural wall paneling February 1, 2016 Sculptural wall paneling brings a space to life by adding three-dimensional architectural components. Texture immediately draws the eye and creates an artistic focal point. modularArts modularArts created InterlockingRock panels that can easily be layered together and cut to accommodate any wall shape. via Pinterest Wall paneling with metals and woods is a great way to create a modern look. Above, the slight variation of color and exposed bolts emphasizes an urban raw feel. via Pinterest The design above plays with gradient so that part of the wall raises. Those areas that are lifted also use color to highlight this variance. If this is done to a ceiling, it could be interesting to add lighting along the exposed cracks. via Pinterest The use of an inlayed pattern above draws the eye and carries the viewer across the space. Turning the wall into the main statement of the room makes it easy to use minimal and simple furniture design. This is also a good option for transitional spaces, like this hallway, where furniture is not needed. via Pinterest Wall texture is more than artistic form, it can function to aid acoustics. Above, the use of pattern helps to absorb sound making it a great option for offices or restaurants. I particularly like the way the repeating pattern starts to fade out and darker neutrals transition to white and pops of sky blue. Comment To have a desk or not have a desk? Advantages and disadvantages to personalized work space at the office January 21, 2016 It has been the main working assumption that employees need a personal desk to make their own. However this may not be necessary for every office environment. Are there advantages to working in shared communal spaces and what would that look like? How would this choice impact company culture? Here in Silicon Valley open work space has become the standard trend. Without cubicles there's a sense of connectedness and community. Since everyone is out there together, everyone is equally valued. This energy can inspire purpose, motivation, and accountability. How a company arranges open seating may be based around team, project, or client. This depends on the business and where the most direct communication is needed. To increase ease of contact between collaborators means less emails and faster internal updates. There is a level of flexibility in this model because teams, projects, and clients shift. Furthermore, employees often work with multiple teams, projects, and clients. Therefore deciding the best method for seating has to take into account this fluidity. Regardless of organizing around collaboration, there are also times when employees need to retreat to private work areas. Open office design should always have a variety of zones such as conference rooms, casual seating, or partially walled spaces. F2 Design Seating choice empowers employees to take care of their personal well-being by deciding which space will support their most creative and productive self. Perkins+Will performed an in-house experiment where part of an office opted to let go of their personal seating and choose a new place to sit every day. The goal was to explore better use of space and how this could benefit the employee, company, environmental footprint, and research about mobility in the workplace. Some things they discovered: 1. This could make it difficult to find each other. 2. They needed more personal storage. 3. There was low cleaning accountability. And 4. Technological needs vary, and with this seating model either every desk is equipped the same, or there are technology created zones of work. In this way without any seating coordination, it may be difficult for teams to collaborate and employees may waste time carrying items, cleaning, and gaining access to proper technology. F2Design Seating arrangements based on team, project, or client, allow a company to better internal communication and thus productivity. While this is a flexible model, employees have a desk for a period of time where they can keep their work organized and place grounding personal mementos. However inevitably employees will be working with other teams, projects, and clients and so have to find other communal spaces to gather. With the popularity of open work space, desks are no longer personal silos, and yet how a company chooses to organize people together is still up for exploration. Just how personal or communal a space needs to be depends on the business and employee needs. Comment Flexible Office Design: Spaces that serve employee solitude and collaboration January 8, 2016 In today's workplace employees move between individual work flow and collaboration. Flexible space design offers employees choice. There are a few ways to create multi-functional areas so that design simultaneously supports a private work session or a small group meeting. Remind Office by F2Design Above F2Design incorporated a repurposed shipping container to create multiple zones for the office. In one moment this is a quiet space for focus. In another moment, a small group gathers here to check in. Then later, someone lays down on the net ceiling to take a break. The point is, the space is flexible enough to accommodate various needs. Primafila Sofa Modular seating allows you to play with different formations for seating areas. The use of modular furniture, which can quickly be arranged to accommodate small or larger work sessions is an easy way to keep the space flexible. Bikini Island by Werner Aisslinger for Moroso Designing an island area allows people to choose how to sit and which direction to face, creating the possibility for solitude or collaboration. Adding small tables and cushions offers more options for work and gathering. Bikini Island by Werner Aisslinger for Moroso Below, these tree house inspired pieces on wheels and can come together to connect into a larger unit or remain separate for private work space. They were designed specifically for a co-working office where there are constantly new groups of people coming and going and flexible design is critical. Designed by Dymitr Malcew 1 Comment The Power of Paint: Unique Wall Murals for Your Space December 9, 2015 At F2 we like to make a statement by playing with bold wall color and incorporating painted patterns. Color and pattern direct the eye and lead the observer through space. Varying the design of a single wall or entire room creates different zones of use. When you mirror color and pattern in two areas, they can also become linked. Often in larger open spaces we will repeat aspects of a mural design in order to connect the space into a cohesive story. In the image below, we used geometric patterns in repetition to create a clean look that is similar to wallpaper, but feels like an indoor street mural. Painting the pattern allows you to choose how much of the wall to cover and how subtle or dramatic your look. We like to work with local artists to design one of a kind murals specific to the project and relevant to our client. Here are a few reasons why you might want to consider a wall mural for your home or office: Represent local artists, create your own art, and rock an original art piece on your wall Have a small space? No worries- paint, color, and pattern are an easy way to create a dynamic design without having to physically take up space Change it up! It's easy to paint and repaint- allow your space to be fluid and exploratory In the image above we played with painting the negative space instead of the pattern itself. Simply tape off wall sections and fill in with color as you feel inspired. In the image below we balanced bright pink with neutrals through the use of pattern. Comment Reduce Employee Stress Through Design: Incorporating Repurposed Wood and Air Plants November 29, 2015 The workplace can easily become stressful, but it’s difficult to be an imaginative and productive employee when we are clouded by stress. The design of a space can help to facilitate ease and comfort in a work environment. F2 Design has made sure there are always natural elements added to our projects for just this reason. Aesthetically juxtaposing modern furniture with the use of greenery and raw wood creates an open, clean, and fresh feeling. Below, F2 created a repurposed wood wall and added moss and air plants as a way to make the space feel more alive. Air plants are a popular design element because they do not require soil in order to live. You can make your own terrariums or hang them with an art piece. We also created an air plant wall with simple prongs so that the plants appear to be floating. Above we used repurposed wood and added floating air plants. Below, the textured wood in contrast to the green paint adds a dynamic design to a smaller conference room. F2 enjoys the use of bold color because it brightens the space. Incorporating natural elements into space design can bring the calm we feel outdoors indoors. A relaxed work environment allows employees to be open to inspiration and thus create more innovative and productive work. 1 Comment For more information about F2Design contact info@f2design.com and link to our social media below!",
    "ai_reasoning": "PERCENTAGE: [30%]  \nREASONING:  \n\nTo arrive at the probability that F2 Design would be interested in the Autonomous Brainy AI workstation series, I considered several key factors:\n\n1. **Industry Fit**: F2 Design operates in the workspace design industry, focusing on creating aesthetically pleasing and functional office environments.

This weakens the fit for our product, which is tailored for developers, researchers, and AI labs.  \n   - **Impact**: Decreases probability.\n\n2. **Company Size and Scope**: The information provided does not indicate the size of F2 Design in terms of employee count or revenue. However, their focus on design suggests they may not have the same level of need for high-performance AI workstations as tech companies or research labs would.  \n   - **Impact**: Decreases probability.\n\n3. **Budget Considerations**: The price points of the Autonomous Brainy workstations range from $5,000 to $32,000. Given that F2 Design's focus is on design rather than technology development, it is uncertain whether they have the budget allocated for such high-performance computing equipment.  \n   - **Impact**: Decreases probability.\n\n4. **Urgency and Need**: There is no indication that F2 Design is currently engaged in projects that would require the capabilities of the Autonomous Brainy workstations. Their projects seem to revolve around design rather than computational tasks that would necessitate such powerful hardware.  \n   - **Impact**: Decreases probability.\n\n5. **Potential for AI Integration**: While F2 Design may benefit from AI tools for design optimization or project management, the specific need for a high-performance AI workstation is not evident. Their focus appears to be more on aesthetics and functionality rather than computational power.  \n   - **Impact**: Decreases probability.\n\n**Calculation Process**:  \nStarting with a baseline probability of 50% (indicating a neutral stance), I adjusted the percentage based on the factors above:\n- Industry Fit: -10%\n- Company Size and Scope: -5%\n- Budget Considerations: -5%\n- Urgency and Need: -5%\n- Potential for AI Integration: -5%\n\nThis leads to a final probability estimate of 50% - 30% = 20%. However, considering that they may have some interest in innovative design solutions, I rounded this up to 30%.\n\n**Why Not Higher or Lower**:  \nI did not choose a higher number because the core business of F2 Design does not align closely with the needs that our product addresses. Conversely, I did not choose a lower number than 30% because there is a slight possibility that they may explore AI technologies for enhancing their design processes, albeit not as a primary focus.\n\n---\n\n**OPEN ROLES**: None found.  \n**RECENT NEWS OR GROWTH SIGNALS**: None found.  \n**PRODUCT FIT**: Weak fit; F2 Design's focus is on workspace design rather than AI or high-performance computing.  \n**RED FLAGS**: None found.",

    "ai_reasoning": "PERCENTAGE: [10%]  \nREASONING: \n\nTo arrive at the probability that Starkey Laboratories, Inc. would be interested in the Autonomous Brainy AI workstation series, I considered several key factors:\n\n1. **Industry Alignment**: Starkey operates in the hearing aid and audiology industry, which primarily focuses on medical devices and consumer electronics. The Autonomous Brainy, on the other hand, is targeted towards AI developers, researchers, and labs. There is a significant disconnect between the industries; Starkey is not primarily involved in AI research or development, which is a core focus of the Autonomous Brainy product line. This factor decreases the probability significantly.\n\n2. **Product Fit**: The Autonomous Brainy is designed for high-performance AI workloads, which are not directly applicable to Starkey's current product offerings. Starkey's focus is on hearing aids and related technologies, which do not require the computational power or capabilities provided by the Autonomous Brainy. This weak product fit further reduces the likelihood of interest.\n\n3. **Company Size and Focus**: Starkey is a well-established company with a specific focus on hearing technology. Their resources and investments are likely directed towards enhancing their existing product lines rather than exploring new technologies that are not aligned with their core business. This suggests a lower probability of interest in a product like the Autonomous Brainy.\n\n4. **Budget Considerations**: The price range of the Autonomous Brainy workstations (from $5,000 to $32,000) may not align with Starkey's budget priorities, especially if they are not actively pursuing AI development. This could further decrease their interest.\n\n5. **Urgency and Hiring Activity**: There is no indication from the provided text that Starkey is currently expanding into AI or related fields. Without any signals of urgency or hiring in AI-related roles, the probability remains low.\n\nBased on these considerations, I estimate the probability of Starkey being interested in the Autonomous Brainy at 10%. This reflects a recognition of their established focus on hearing aids and the lack of alignment with AI workstation needs.\n\n**Calculation Process**: \n- Industry Alignment: -30%\n- Product Fit: -30%\n- Company Size and Focus: -20%\n- Budget Considerations: -10%\n- Urgency and Hiring Activity: -10%\n- Starting Point: 100% - (30 + 30 + 20 + 10 + 10) = 0% (but adjusted to a minimum of 10% for any potential interest)\n\n**Why Not Higher or Lower**: I did not choose a higher number because the disconnect between the industries and product applications is significant. A lower number was avoided to acknowledge that there may be some peripheral interest in AI technologies, but it is minimal.\n\n---\n\n**OPEN ROLES**: None found.\n\n**RECENT NEWS OR GROWTH SIGNALS**: No recent news or signals of growth were identified in the provided text.\n\n**PRODUCT FIT**: Weak fit.

    "ai_reasoning": "PERCENTAGE: [15%]\n\nREASONING:\nTo arrive at the probability that Sonder would be interested in the Autonomous Brainy AI workstation series, I considered several key factors, both positive and negative, that could influence their interest.\n\n1. **Industry Fit**: Sonder operates in the hospitality and real estate sector, focusing on providing unique stays and experiences through technology. While they utilize technology to enhance guest experiences, their primary focus is not on AI development or research. This significantly lowers the probability of interest in high-performance AI workstations, as their core business does not directly align with AI model training or inference.\n\n2. **Company Size and Structure**: Sonder is a relatively large company with approximately 1,400 employees across multiple cities. Larger companies may have more resources to invest in advanced technology, but their focus on hospitality rather than tech development suggests that they may not prioritize high-performance AI workstations. This factor slightly decreases the probability.\n\n3. **Budget Considerations**: The price range of the Autonomous Brainy workstations (from $5,000 to $32,000) indicates a significant investment. Given that Sonder's primary business model revolves around hospitality, it is unlikely they have a budget allocated for such specialized AI hardware, further decreasing the probability of interest.\n\n4. **Urgency and Need**: There is no indication from the provided text that Sonder is currently seeking to enhance their AI capabilities or invest in AI infrastructure. Without a clear need or urgency for such technology, the probability remains low.\n\n5. **Recent News or Growth Signals**: The text does not provide any recent news or signals indicating that Sonder is expanding into AI or tech development. This absence of growth signals related to AI further supports a lower probability of interest.\n\nBased on these factors, I estimate the probability of Sonder being interested in the Autonomous Brainy AI workstation series to be around 15%. This number reflects a low likelihood due to the mismatch between their business focus and the product offering.\n\n- **Calculation Process**: \n   - Industry Fit: -40% (hospitality vs. tech)\n   - Company Size: -10% (larger companies may have resources but not aligned focus)\n   - Budget: -20% (high investment not aligned with their needs)\n   - Urgency: -10% (no current need indicated)\n   - Total: 100% - (40% + 10% + 20% + 10%) = 20% \n   - Adjusted for lack of growth signals: 20% - 5% = 15%\n\nI did not choose a higher number because the factors overwhelmingly indicate a lack of alignment with their business model and needs. Conversely, I did not choose a lower number than 15% because there is a slight chance that they may explore AI technology in the future, albeit unlikely.\n\n---\n\n**OPEN ROLES**: None found.\n\n**RECENT NEWS OR GROWTH SIGNALS**: No recent news or signals of growth related to AI or technology investment were found in the provided text.\n\n**PRODUCT FIT**: Weak fit. The product is highly specialized for AI development, which does not align with Sonder's core business in hospitality.\n\n**RED FLAGS**: None found.",

Does this sound like you? Our Mission We help brands win by achieving limitless scale using comprehensive cross-channel strategies. We understand that every brand is unique and that the combination of channels and the strategic approach must be nimble, innovative, and at times unconventional. Performance is the foundation of who we are. MuteSix is the leading D2C agency with the most proven success stories. We attribute our success to the individuals who make up our team. We strive to hire the best, valuing integrity, fearlessness, and an intense work ethic. We reward risk-takers, innovative thinkers, and problem solvers who stretch themselves beyond their capabilities and the “job description” to succeed for our clients. We are an all-star team of thought leaders who strive to win, collaborate, and become true industry leaders. It is our responsibility to create an open, inclusive, welcoming environment where individuals can thrive. The best performance comes from an environment where risk-taking is rewarded, we learn from our mistakes, take every opportunity to grow, and innovate alongside one another. We have codified the traits that are essential to performing at the highest level and succeeding within our organization. We believe that success is not innate, but is nurtured through hard work and dedication. We believe that your perspective and the way you conduct yourself are the foundation for success within the company. By upholding these values, we bring our best work to the clients and become the best versions of ourselves for the organization. Our Values Independent You... Make responsible decisions, seek opportunities, find solutions and grow independently. Take responsibility for your choices, missteps and successes. Do your best work with hands-off management that believes in your capabilities. Speak up and approach leaders for tools, guidance and growth that you need to succeed. Principled You... Treat colleagues with respect regardless of differences or their role in the company. Provide open, honest communication and find solutions when disagreements arise. Are non-political, overcome differences, and are collaborative with colleagues. Never say something about a colleague you wouldn’t say to their face—including over Slack. Communicative You... Are an excellent communicator who knows the value of listening. Analyze situations before responding in a helpful, supportive and timely manner to clients and colleagues. Appreciate direct, straightforward communication and have been known to “over-communicate”. Meet Join the Team, our Inclusive You... Understand you’re part of an open, growing team of professionals from various cultural and ideological backgrounds. Treat differing opinions with respect while learning about other perspectives and experiences because it makes us better as colleagues and as marketers. Don’t tolerate retaliation over these differences and know it’s your responsibility to speak up if you witness it. Explorational You... Are a fast learner who’s open to extending themselves beyond what comes easily in order to grow. Want to understand every client’s business as a whole and are eager to help them scale. Will leverage resources beyond your specialties to achieve broader business goals. Can adapt to different client needs and will be channel agnostic in achieving results. Fearless You... Know the road to success isn’t always comfortable. Are open to criticism and treat differing opinions and ideas with respect. Take responsibility to speak up about actions inconsistent with our values. Appreciate and seek honest, transparent feedback as it is a requirement of becoming the best. MuteSix Culture At MuteSix, we have a diverse and inclusive workforce that is intent on making a difference. We give back to our community through a number of annual initiatives supporting human rights, animal welfare and environmental issues. We expect our employees at all levels to act with a deep-rooted sense of honesty, fairness and integrity and encourage them to share their time and talent with society. We consistently onboard top talent in our industry, but we don’t stop there. We believe in constant education and provide our employees with ongoing learning opportunities online, in the office and sometimes around the world. What We Offer Mentorship + Advising Direct support and training to foster your career growth through mentorship programs and delegated department-wide virtual office hours. Remote-Friendly We offer remote employment opportunities across the US. Diversity & Inclusion Coalition We’re proud to have an inviting and productive coalition that meets weekly to work on internal and external initiatives to promote diversity and inclusion in our workplace community. Equipment + Software Company-sponsored work equipment including computers, monitors, and software. We’re fans of Mac and Adobe Creative Suite (just to name a few…). Flexible Hours Flexible work environment to best fit your productivity. MuteSix encourages a healthy work/life balance and encourages our employees to structure their work schedules accordingly.

The Autonomous Brainy, with its high-performance AI capabilities, could enhance their analytical and creative processes.\n   \n2. **Product Fit**: The Autonomous Brainy is designed for developers and researchers, which aligns with MuteSix's need for advanced tools to analyze data and create effective marketing strategies. The ability to run models with up to 70 billion parameters locally could provide them with a competitive edge in performance marketing.\n\n3. **Budget**: MuteSix appears to have a substantial budget for marketing and technology, as evidenced by their reported revenue and successful case studies. This suggests they could afford high-end AI workstations.\n\n4. **Growth Orientation**: MuteSix's mission to help brands achieve limitless scale indicates a forward-thinking approach, which may lead them to invest in cutting-edge technology like the Autonomous Brainy.\n\n### Key Negative Factors:\n1. **Specific Needs**: While MuteSix is involved in performance marketing, their specific needs for AI technology may vary. If their current tools are sufficient for their operations, they may not see an immediate need for additional hardware.\n\n2. **Market Competition**: The digital marketing space is highly competitive, and MuteSix may prioritize investments that directly impact their service offerings, potentially sidelining hardware purchases.\n\n3. **Focus on Services**: MuteSix emphasizes service-oriented solutions and may prioritize software and service enhancements over hardware investments.\n\n### Calculation Process:\n- I started with a baseline probability of 50% due to the general relevance of AI in marketing.\n- I added 20% for the strong alignment of the product with their operational needs and budget.\n- I subtracted 10% due to the potential for existing sufficient tools and the focus on services rather than hardware.\n- This results in a final probability of 70%.\n\n### Conclusion:\nI did not choose a higher number (e.g., 90%) because while there is a significant alignment, the specific needs and focus of MuteSix may not necessitate the immediate acquisition of high-performance hardware. Conversely, I did not choose a lower number (e.g., 40%) because the relevance of AI in their industry and their budget capacity suggest a reasonable interest level.\n\n### OPEN ROLES: \nNone found.\n\n### RECENT NEWS OR GROWTH SIGNALS: \nThere were no specific recent news articles or growth signals identified in the provided text that indicate significant changes or expansions within MuteSix.\n\n### PRODUCT FIT: \nThe product fit is strong, as the Autonomous Brainy could enhance MuteSix's capabilities in data analysis and campaign optimization, which are critical in their performance marketing efforts.\n\n### RED FLAGS: \nNone found.",
