=== Starkey Hearing (http://starkey.com) ===
Hiring: Yes
Hiring Reasoning: Upon analyzing the company's website and additional sources, there are several indicators that suggest Starkey is likely hiring. 

1. **Careers Page Exists**: The presence of a careers page, even without specific job listings, is a strong indicator that the company is open to hiring. This suggests they may have positions available or are preparing to hire.

2. **Navigation Links**: The website includes a "Careers" link in the navigation menu, which typically indicates that the company is focused on recruitment and employment opportunities.

3. **Potential for Growth**: While the website content does not explicitly mention growth or expansion, the nature of the hearing aid industry and the mention of innovative products (like Edge AI hearing aids) implies that the company may be expanding its workforce to support new product lines.

4. **Employee Testimonials**: The mention of a positive experience with Starkey hearing aids by Daymond John suggests that the company values its employees and their experiences, which can be a sign of a healthy work environment that may be hiring.

5. **Contact Information**: The website provides a contact number and options to schedule appointments, which could imply that they are also open to inquiries about employment.

Given these indicators, it is reasonable to conclude that Starkey is likely hiring or at least open to hiring in the near future. Therefore, I marked the decision as YES.
Additional Sources: Careers page info: Careers page exists but no clear job listings | AI decided to stop exploring: The current page does not contain any strong hiring indicators such as job listings or a careers section. The available links do not lead to any hiring information, and there are no relevant links that suggest job opportunities or company hiring practices. Therefore, I will stop my search here.

AI Reasoning: PERCENTAGE: [10%]

REASONING:
To arrive at the probability that Starkey Laboratories, Inc. would be interested in the Autonomous Brainy AI workstation series, I considered several key factors that influence the likelihood of interest in our product.

1. **Industry Fit**: Starkey operates in the hearing aid industry, focusing on audio technology and health-related products. The Autonomous Brainy is designed for AI development, research, and model training, which does not directly align with Starkey's core business of hearing aids. This significantly decreases the probability of interest. (Negative factor)

2. **Product Relevance**: The Autonomous Brainy is tailored for developers and researchers working with AI models, particularly in fields like machine learning and data science. Starkey's focus is on enhancing hearing technology rather than developing AI models or computational hardware. This lack of relevance to their business needs further reduces the probability of interest. (Negative factor)

3. **Company Size and Focus**: Starkey is a well-established company with a specific focus on hearing aids and related technologies. Their resources and strategic direction are likely concentrated on improving their existing product lines rather than investing in high-performance AI workstations. This suggests a low likelihood of them needing such a product. (Negative factor)

4. **Budget Considerations**: While Starkey may have the financial capability to invest in high-performance computing, their budget is likely allocated towards R&D in hearing technology rather than AI workstations. The high cost of the Autonomous Brainy series (ranging from $5,000 to $32,000) may not align with their current financial priorities. (Negative factor)

5. **Urgency and Need**: There is no indication that Starkey is currently pursuing AI development or requiring high-performance computing for their operations. Without a clear need or urgency for such technology, the probability of interest remains low. (Negative factor)

In summary, the combination of Starkey's industry focus, the lack of relevance of the Autonomous Brainy to their core business, budget allocation, and absence of urgency leads to a low probability of interest. 

I did not choose a higher percentage because the factors overwhelmingly indicate that Starkey's business model and strategic goals do not align with the offerings of the Autonomous Brainy. A percentage higher than 10% would imply a level of interest or relevance that simply does not exist based on the information available. Conversely, I did not go lower than 10% because there is a slight chance that Starkey may explore AI technologies in the future, albeit not in the immediate term or with the current product offering.

=== We Are Cultura (http://wearecultura.com) ===
Hiring: Yes
Hiring Reasoning: The analysis of Cultura's website and additional sources reveals several indicators of hiring activity. 

1. **Careers Page**: The presence of a dedicated careers page indicates that the company is focused on recruitment, even though there are currently no specific job openings listed. This alone is a strong indicator of potential hiring activity.

2. **"Join our team" Messaging**: The website explicitly states, "We are always looking for new stars to bring into our team," which suggests an ongoing interest in expanding their workforce.

3. **Contact Information for Job Applications**: The website provides a specific email address (abenge@wearecultura.com) for sending resumes, which is a clear sign of recruitment activity.

4. **Core Values and Hiring Based on Them**: The company emphasizes that they hire based on their core values, indicating a structured approach to recruitment and a commitment to finding the right fit for their team.

5. **Employee Development and Learning Opportunities**: The mention of continuous learning and growth opportunities suggests that the company is investing in its employees, which often correlates with hiring to support such initiatives.

6. **General Company Growth**: The company’s description of its mission and values, along with its status as a preferred dealer, implies a focus on growth and potentially expanding their team to meet business demands.

Given these indicators, it is reasonable to conclude that Cultura is actively engaged in hiring or at least preparing for future hiring, despite the lack of current job openings. Therefore, the decision is marked as YES.

AI Reasoning: PERCENTAGE: [30%]

REASONING:
To arrive at the 30% probability that Cultura would be interested in the Autonomous Brainy AI workstation series, I considered several key factors, both positive and negative, that influence the likelihood of their interest in our product.

1. **Industry Fit**: Cultura operates as a full-service furniture dealership, primarily focused on creating workspaces and enhancing workplace culture. While they emphasize design and installation, their core business does not directly involve AI or high-performance computing. This weakens the fit for our product, which is tailored for developers, researchers, and AI labs. This factor decreases the probability of interest.

2. **Company Size and Scope**: Cultura is a well-established company with a significant presence in Southern California, having served over 1250 companies. However, their focus on furniture and workspace solutions suggests that their primary needs are not aligned with high-performance AI workstations. This factor also decreases the probability of interest.

3. **Budget Considerations**: The pricing of the Autonomous Brainy series ranges from $5,000 to $32,000. While Cultura may have the financial capacity to invest in such technology, their primary business model does not indicate a need for AI workstations. This factor does not significantly increase the probability, as their budget is likely allocated towards furniture and workspace solutions rather than computing hardware.

4. **Urgency and Need**: There is no indication from the provided text that Cultura has an immediate need for AI workstations. Their focus appears to be on enhancing workplace culture and design rather than on AI development or research. This lack of urgency further decreases the probability of interest.

5. **Hiring Activity**: The text mentions that Cultura is always looking for new talent, which indicates growth and potential expansion. However, the nature of their hiring does not suggest a shift towards AI or tech-focused roles that would necessitate high-performance workstations. This factor does not contribute positively to the probability.

6. **Potential for AI Integration**: While there is a possibility that Cultura could integrate AI into their design processes or operational strategies in the future, there is no current evidence or indication of this trend in their business model. This speculative nature does not significantly enhance the probability.

In summary, the combination of a misaligned industry focus, lack of immediate need, and the absence of a clear integration of AI into their operations leads to a conservative estimate of 30%. I did not choose a higher number because the core business of Cultura does not align with the target market for the Autonomous Brainy series, and I did not choose a lower number because there is a slight possibility that they could explore AI solutions in the future, albeit not in the immediate term.

AI Reasoning: PERCENTAGE: [10%]  
REASONING:  

To arrive at the probability that City Storage Systems would be interested in the Autonomous Brainy AI workstation series, I considered several key factors:

1. **Industry Relevance**: City Storage Systems operates in the food delivery and logistics sector, primarily through their CloudKitchens and related products. This industry is not primarily focused on AI research or development, which is the main target for the Autonomous Brainy workstations. This factor significantly decreases the probability of interest.

2. **Product Fit**: The Autonomous Brainy workstations are designed for high-performance AI tasks, such as model training and inference, which are more relevant to AI labs, developers, and researchers. City Storage Systems does not appear to be in a position where they would require such high-performance AI capabilities for their operations. This further reduces the likelihood of interest.

3. **Budget Considerations**: The pricing of the Autonomous Brainy workstations ranges from $5,000 to $32,000. While City Storage Systems may have the budget for such purchases, the necessity of investing in AI workstations for their specific business model is questionable. This factor also contributes to a lower probability.

4. **Urgency and Need**: There is no indication that City Storage Systems is currently engaged in AI development or research that would necessitate the use of high-performance AI workstations. Without a clear need or urgency for such technology, the probability remains low.

5. **Company Size and Focus**: City Storage Systems appears to be focused on logistics and food delivery solutions rather than technology development. Their core business model does not suggest a strong inclination towards adopting advanced AI workstations, which further diminishes the probability of interest.

Taking these factors into account, I estimated the probability of interest at 10%. This number reflects the minimal relevance of the Autonomous Brainy workstations to City Storage Systems' operations and strategic focus. I did not choose a higher number because the lack of direct applicability of the product to their business model and the absence of any indication of AI-related initiatives significantly outweigh any potential interest. Conversely, I did not choose a lower number than 10% because there is always a slight chance that a company may explore new technologies, even if it is not their primary focus.

=== f2design.com (http://f2design.com) ===
Hiring: Yes
Hiring Reasoning: Upon analyzing the content from F2 Design's website and their LinkedIn page, there are several indicators suggesting that the company is likely hiring or at least open to hiring. 

1. **LinkedIn Page**: The LinkedIn page for F2 Design has a description that indicates they strive to provide the best solutions to problems, which often implies a need for talent to achieve this goal. Although there are no specific job postings listed, the presence of a LinkedIn page itself is a weak indicator of hiring activity.

2. **Company Size**: The company has only 2 employees, which suggests that they may be in a growth phase and could be looking to expand their team. This is a common scenario for small companies, especially in the design industry, where project demands can lead to hiring needs.

3. **Contact Information**: The website provides multiple email addresses for contact, including general inquiries. While there is no specific mention of job applications, the presence of contact information can indicate openness to inquiries about potential employment.

4. **Blog Content**: The blog content discusses various design concepts and workplace strategies, which may imply that the company is actively engaged in projects that could require additional staff. The focus on workplace design and employee experience suggests a forward-thinking approach that often accompanies hiring initiatives.

5. **No Explicit Hiring Messaging**: While there are no direct statements like "We're hiring" or "Join our team," the overall context of the website and the LinkedIn presence suggests that they may be open to hiring, especially given their small size and the nature of their work.

Overall, while there are no strong indicators such as job listings or a dedicated careers page, the combination of a small team size, the potential for growth, and the presence of contact information leads to the conclusion that F2 Design is likely hiring or at least open to hiring discussions. Therefore, I marked it as YES.

To arrive at the probability that F2 Design would be interested in the Autonomous Brainy AI workstation series, I considered several key factors that could influence their interest level. 

1. **Industry Fit**: F2 Design operates in the workspace design industry, focusing on creating aesthetically pleasing and functional work environments. While they emphasize thoughtful design and employee experience, their primary offerings do not directly relate to high-performance computing or AI technologies. This factor decreases the probability of interest, as their core business does not align with the technical capabilities of the Autonomous Brainy workstations.

2. **Target Audience**: The Autonomous Brainy is aimed at developers, researchers, and AI labs, which are not the primary clientele of F2 Design. Their focus is more on design and architecture rather than technology development or AI research. This misalignment further reduces the likelihood of interest.

3. **Budget Considerations**: The price range of the Autonomous Brainy workstations (from $5,000 to $32,000) suggests a significant investment. F2 Design may not have the budget allocated for such high-performance computing equipment, especially if their projects are more focused on design elements rather than computational power. This factor decreases the probability as well.

4. **Urgency and Need**: There is no indication from the provided text that F2 Design has an immediate need for AI workstations. Their projects seem to revolve around design and aesthetics rather than computational tasks that would require such powerful hardware. This lack of urgency diminishes the probability of interest.

5. **Potential Use Cases**: While there could be potential applications for AI workstations in design (e.g., using AI for design simulations or rendering), the text does not suggest that F2 Design is currently exploring these avenues. This uncertainty leads to a lower probability of interest.

6. **Company Size and Structure**: The company appears to be relatively small, as indicated by the limited contact information and the focus on personalized design. Smaller firms may have less need for high-performance computing resources compared to larger companies or dedicated tech firms, which further decreases the probability.

In summary, the combination of industry fit, target audience misalignment, budget constraints, lack of urgency, and the company's size led me to estimate a probability of 30%. I did not choose a higher number because the core business of F2 Design does not align with the needs for high-performance AI workstations, and I did not choose a lower number because there is a slight chance they may explore AI applications in their design process in the future. However, this potential is not strong enough to warrant a significantly higher probability.

5. **Potential Use Cases**: While there could be potential applications for AI workstations in design (e.g., using AI for design simulations or rendering), the text does not suggest that F2 Design is currently exploring these avenues. This uncertainty leads to a lower probability of interest.

6. **Company Size and Structure**: The company appears to be relatively small, as indicated by the limited contact information and the focus on personalized design. Smaller firms may have less need for high-performance computing resources compared to larger companies or dedicated tech firms, which further decreases the probability.

In summary, the combination of industry fit, target audience misalignment, budget constraints, lack of urgency, and the company's size led me to estimate a probability of 30%. I did not choose a higher number because the core business of F2 Design does not align with the needs for high-performance AI workstations, and I did not choose a lower number because there is a slight chance they may explore AI applications in their design process in the future. However, this potential is not strong enough to warrant a significantly higher probability.

But that doesn't mean the sunshine has to feel quite so far away. Bring the outdoors indoors with turf inspired seating or grass installations. This is particularly a great option for stadium seating and open floor space. officesnapshots.com Add some color and freshness with turf inspired setting in break out areas. Great for personal work and meet ups. officedesigngallery.com Use a fabric that mimics grass as an upholstery option for furniture. The benches above are also made with unfinished wood and placed on wheels for a natural feel and multi-functional design. diyandmag.com The seating installation above has grass weaving between seats so that workers can face outward or inward (and maybe even feel the grass between their toes). abduzeedo.com A grass inspired rug is a great way to brighten up a room. architectureinteriordesigns.com Grass inspired stadium seating is also great for lecture and presentation rooms. examiner.com Create rolling hills and playful shapes with turf inspired seating. Comment Turn your wall to art with sculptural wall paneling February 1, 2016 Sculptural wall paneling brings a space to life by adding three-dimensional architectural components. Texture immediately draws the eye and creates an artistic focal point. modularArts modularArts created InterlockingRock panels that can easily be layered together and cut to accommodate any wall shape. via Pinterest Wall paneling with metals and woods is a great way to create a modern look. Above, the slight variation of color and exposed bolts emphasizes an urban raw feel. via Pinterest The design above plays with gradient so that part of the wall raises. Those areas that are lifted also use color to highlight this variance. If this is done to a ceiling, it could be interesting to add lighting along the exposed cracks. via Pinterest The use of an inlayed pattern above draws the eye and carries the viewer across the space. Turning the wall into the main statement of the room makes it easy to use minimal and simple furniture design. This is also a good option for transitional spaces, like this hallway, where furniture is not needed. via Pinterest Wall texture is more than artistic form, it can function to aid acoustics. Above, the use of pattern helps to absorb sound making it a great option for offices or restaurants. I particularly like the way the repeating pattern starts to fade out and darker neutrals transition to white and pops of sky blue. Comment To have a desk or not have a desk? Advantages and disadvantages to personalized work space at the office January 21, 2016 It has been the main working assumption that employees need a personal desk to make their own. However this may not be necessary for every office environment. Are there advantages to working in shared communal spaces and what would that look like? How would this choice impact company culture? Here in Silicon Valley open work space has become the standard trend. Without cubicles there's a sense of connectedness and community. Since everyone is out there together, everyone is equally valued. This energy can inspire purpose, motivation, and accountability. How a company arranges open seating may be based around team, project, or client. This depends on the business and where the most direct communication is needed. To increase ease of contact between collaborators means less emails and faster internal updates. There is a level of flexibility in this model because teams, projects, and clients shift. Furthermore, employees often work with multiple teams, projects, and clients. Therefore deciding the best method for seating has to take into account this fluidity. Regardless of organizing around collaboration, there are also times when employees need to retreat to private work areas. Open office design should always have a variety of zones such as conference rooms, casual seating, or partially walled spaces. F2 Design Seating choice empowers employees to take care of their personal well-being by deciding which space will support their most creative and productive self. Perkins+Will performed an in-house experiment where part of an office opted to let go of their personal seating and choose a new place to sit every day. The goal was to explore better use of space and how this could benefit the employee, company, environmental footprint, and research about mobility in the workplace. Some things they discovered: 1. This could make it difficult to find each other. 2. They needed more personal storage. 3. There was low cleaning accountability. And 4. Technological needs vary, and with this seating model either every desk is equipped the same, or there are technology created zones of work. In this way without any seating coordination, it may be difficult for teams to collaborate and employees may waste time carrying items, cleaning, and gaining access to proper technology. F2Design Seating arrangements based on team, project, or client, allow a company to better internal communication and thus productivity. While this is a flexible model, employees have a desk for a period of time where they can keep their work organized and place grounding personal mementos. However inevitably employees will be working with other teams, projects, and clients and so have to find other communal spaces to gather. With the popularity of open work space, desks are no longer personal silos, and yet how a company chooses to organize people together is still up for exploration. Just how personal or communal a space needs to be depends on the business and employee needs. Comment Flexible Office Design: Spaces that serve employee solitude and collaboration January 8, 2016 In today's workplace employees move between individual work flow and collaboration. Flexible space design offers employees choice. There are a few ways to create multi-functional areas so that design simultaneously supports a private work session or a small group meeting. Remind Office by F2Design Above F2Design incorporated a repurposed shipping container to create multiple zones for the office. In one moment this is a quiet space for focus. In another moment, a small group gathers here to check in. Then later, someone lays down on the net ceiling to take a break. The point is, the space is flexible enough to accommodate various needs. Primafila Sofa Modular seating allows you to play with different formations for seating areas. The use of modular furniture, which can quickly be arranged to accommodate small or larger work sessions is an easy way to keep the space flexible. Bikini Island by Werner Aisslinger for Moroso Designing an island area allows people to choose how to sit and which direction to face, creating the possibility for solitude or collaboration. Adding small tables and cushions offers more options for work and gathering. Bikini Island by Werner Aisslinger for Moroso Below, these tree house inspired pieces on wheels and can come together to connect into a larger unit or remain separate for private work space. They were designed specifically for a co-working office where there are constantly new groups of people coming and going and flexible design is critical. Designed by Dymitr Malcew 1 Comment The Power of Paint: Unique Wall Murals for Your Space December 9, 2015 At F2 we like to make a statement by playing with bold wall color and incorporating painted patterns. Color and pattern direct the eye and lead the observer through space. Varying the design of a single wall or entire room creates different zones of use. When you mirror color and pattern in two areas, they can also become linked. Often in larger open spaces we will repeat aspects of a mural design in order to connect the space into a cohesive story. In the image below, we used geometric patterns in repetition to create a clean look that is similar to wallpaper, but feels like an indoor street mural. Painting the pattern allows you to choose how much of the wall to cover and how subtle or dramatic your look. We like to work with local artists to design one of a kind murals specific to the project and relevant to our client. Here are a few reasons why you might want to consider a wall mural for your home or office: Represent local artists, create your own art, and rock an original art piece on your wall Have a small space? No worries- paint, color, and pattern are an easy way to create a dynamic design without having to physically take up space Change it up! It's easy to paint and repaint- allow your space to be fluid and exploratory In the image above we played with painting the negative space instead of the pattern itself. Simply tape off wall sections and fill in with color as you feel inspired. In the image below we balanced bright pink with neutrals through the use of pattern. Comment Reduce Employee Stress Through Design: Incorporating Repurposed Wood and Air Plants November 29, 2015 The workplace can easily become stressful, but it’s difficult to be an imaginative and productive employee when we are clouded by stress. The design of a space can help to facilitate ease and comfort in a work environment. F2 Design has made sure there are always natural elements added to our projects for just this reason. Aesthetically juxtaposing modern furniture with the use of greenery and raw wood creates an open, clean, and fresh feeling. Below, F2 created a repurposed wood wall and added moss and air plants as a way to make the space feel more alive. Air plants are a popular design element because they do not require soil in order to live. You can make your own terrariums or hang them with an art piece. We also created an air plant wall with simple prongs so that the plants appear to be floating. Above we used repurposed wood and added floating air plants. Below, the textured wood in contrast to the green paint adds a dynamic design to a smaller conference room. F2 enjoys the use of bold color because it brightens the space. Incorporating natural elements into space design can bring the calm we feel outdoors indoors. A relaxed work environment allows employees to be open to inspiration and thus create more innovative and productive work. 1 Comment For more information about F2Design contact info@f2design.com and link to our social media below!
